## Introduction

This project serves as a sandbox for learning and experimenting with frontend development concepts, with a focus on Next.js and TypeScript. Here, I work on building components, implementing best practices, and setting up a smooth developer experience with Prettier for formatting.

## Features

- Next.js setup with TypeScript integration for type safety and maintainability
- JavaScript for dynamic interactions and logic
- CSS for styling components and layouts
- Node.js as the runtime environment for server-side development
- Prettier configuration for consistent code formatting

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: React framework for building optimized and fast web applications
- **TypeScript**: JavaScript with types for a more reliable and maintainable codebase
- **JavaScript**: Core language for creating dynamic frontend functionality
- **CSS**: Styling and layout control for the UI components
- **Node.js**: Server-side runtime environment
- **Prettier**: Code formatter to maintain a clean and consistent code style

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine
- A package manager like npm or yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git
   ```

2. **Navigate into the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd your-repository-name
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The app should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

*This repository contains examples, experiments, and projects intended for learning. Feel free to explore each folder and file to understand the implementation of frontend concepts in Next.js and TypeScript.*
